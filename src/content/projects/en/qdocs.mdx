**Qdocs** is a tool designed to make presentations more dynamic. It allows you to manage and edit animations on a scene-by-scene basis. This gives users precise control over the flow of their presentations and makes it easier to define complex animation movements.

The project is managed on [Github](https://github.com/winetree94/qdocs), and you can try it out through the [Live Preview](https://qdocs.winetree94.com). For more detailed information about the project, please refer to the [WIKI](https://github.com/winetree94/qdocs/wiki).

### What's Different

The goal of a presentation is to captivate the audience within a limited time. While good speaking skills are important, visually engaging materials are also crucial.

One feature I often use in presentations is '**animation**'. Showing diagrams or charts with animation can help increase the audience's understanding.

However, creating such content with existing presentation tools isn't easy. Below is a part of a presentation I used during an internal seminar.

<br />

The animations used in the presentation above mainly involve moving objects and fade-in/out effects. But if you open the actual PPT file, it looks like this:

<br />

In tools like PowerPoint or Keynote, animations for objects are managed and displayed all at once within the same page. This makes it hard to see how a specific '**scene**' will look during the editing process. As a result, the UI becomes cluttered and difficult to manage as soon as the animations get a bit complex.

<br />

Qdocs addresses this issue by allowing you to create presentations based on animation scenes rather than pages.

One of the key goals is to enable editing by animation scenes rather than by document pages, as shown above. This approach allows users to precisely understand and control the document flow, making it easier to define complex animation movements.

### Current Status

Qdocs started as a project to enter an open-source software competition with my colleagues. Unfortunately, we didn't win, and the team members have since dispersed, leaving me to continue working on it alone. I personally find this project very promising and plan to continue developing it in my spare time.
