**Qdocs** is a tool designed to make presentations more dynamic. Unlike traditional presentation tools, Qdocs allows you to manage and edit animations on a scene-by-scene basis. This enables users to precisely control the flow of their presentations and easily define more complex animation sequences.

The project is managed on [Github](https://github.com/winetree94/qdocs) and you can try it out via the [Live Preview](https://winetree94.github.io/VectorOptimizer). For more detailed information, please refer to the project [WIKI](https://github.com/winetree94/qdocs/wiki).

### Core Concept

The goal of a presentation is to captivate the audience within a limited time frame. While eloquence is important, engaging visuals are equally crucial in maintaining the audience's attention.

One feature I frequently use in presentations is **animation**. Animating diagrams or charts can significantly enhance audience comprehension.

However, creating such content with traditional presentation tools is not easy. Below is a snippet from a presentation I delivered at an internal seminar.

<br />

The animations used in this presentation primarily involve object movement and Fade In/Out effects. However, if you open the actual PPT file used to create it, you'll see something like this:

In most tools like PowerPoint or Keynote, object animations are managed and displayed simultaneously within a single page. This makes it difficult to see the specific appearance of each **scene** during the editing process. As a result, even slightly complex animations can make the UI cluttered and hard to edit.

<br />

The Queue aims to solve these animation management issues by allowing presentations to be created on an animation scene basis rather than a page basis. Each of these scenes is managed using the term **‘Queue’**. The image below is an example of an edited document.

One of the key objectives is to enable editing based on animation scenes rather than specific pages, as shown above. This approach allows users to accurately understand and control the document flow, making it easier to define more complex animation sequences.
