This project is a JavaScript/TypeScript reimplementation of [Bobby Fraser's 'Curves' C# Project](https://gitlab.com/burningmime/curves).

Curves is a vector optimization utility that I have rewritten to work in both browser and Node.js environments.

### How Does It Work?

If a user draws a line with a pen or mouse in the browser, the points will appear as shown below.

Connecting these points with straight lines results in the following representation.

While this somewhat resembles the intended shape, it contains too many points and the connections between lines appear unnatural.

Using this project, you can reduce the number of points and create smooth curves as shown below.
