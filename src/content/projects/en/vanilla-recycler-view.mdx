VanillaRecyclerView is a high-performance UI rendering library designed to efficiently manage and render large amounts of data on the web. Built with pure JavaScript, it offers ease of use and powerful functionality.

It's perfect for scenarios where you need to repeatedly display numerous DOM elements in a scroll area, like on Instagram.

Key features include:

#### Virtualized DOM

Only the visible portion of the scroll area is rendered in real-time, both horizontally and vertically. This improves the initial rendering speed of the page and boosts overall performance.

#### Reusable DOM

Instead of creating new DOM elements every moment, it reuses the existing ones that have scrolled out of view. This minimizes performance degradation caused by real-time rendering during scrolling.
