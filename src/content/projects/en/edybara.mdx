### Core Concept

ProseMirror is a powerful tool that allows users to create almost anything they can imagine in a text editor. You can customize nearly every aspect of formatting and UI/UX to meet business requirements.

However, ProseMirror is more of a framework for building editors than a ready-to-use library. It requires significant additional development to be usable, and its extensive API can be challenging to learn.

Edybara addresses these issues. It provides pre-defined formats and plugins that make ProseMirror easy to start with. This allows users to quickly implement and deploy a ProseMirror-based editor.

Edybara is developed and distributed independently for each feature, providing standard ProseMirror API endpoints (Schema, Plugin). This means that even existing ProseMirror projects can incorporate parts of Edybaraâ€™s functionality.
