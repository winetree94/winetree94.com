VanillaRecyclerView is a high-performance UI rendering library designed to efficiently manage and render large sets of data on the web. Built with pure JavaScript to avoid dependencies on any frameworks, it offers a simple API for easy use.

Key features include:

#### Virtualized DOM

Only the portion of the DOM that the user is currently viewing is rendered in real-time within the entire scroll area, whether horizontal or vertical. This improves the initial page load speed and enhances overall performance.

#### Reusable DOM

Instead of creating new DOM elements every time, the existing DOM elements that have moved out of the current scroll area are reused. This minimizes the performance impact of real-time rendering on scrolling performance.

The project is managed on [Github](https://github.com/winetree94/VanillaRecyclerView) and is available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-recycler-view).
